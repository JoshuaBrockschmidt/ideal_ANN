# ideal_ANN
Uses a genetic algorithm to find the optimal configuration for an ANN given a number of inputs neurons, outputs neurons, and testing data.

Expirmental synthesis of two well-known artificial intelligence algorithms. This small project is grounded in the concept of self-teaching AI structures.
